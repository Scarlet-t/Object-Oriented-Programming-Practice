I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

++==============================++

Through the workshop and ms2 I learned what a pure virtual function is, which is a function with no implementation in the base class but needs to be implemented in the derived class. 

I also learned that a class is an abstract class if it declares at least a pure virtual function as it cannot be instantiated to an object. An abstract base class is a base class that provides a common interface for all the derived class and could contain both pure virtual functions and regular functions. 

The Account class in the workshop presents an abstract base class because its derivative classes, SavingsAccount, and ChequingAccount, are derived from it and shares common functions. 

I also learned how the concrete class implements the pure virtual functions. Implementing the virtual functions in the derivative class has helped me understand how to use them. I learned through an error that the derivative class must implement all the pure virtual functions that are found in the base class. the hands-on experience helped me better understand the concepts we had gone through in the course.

I also now better understand how an abstract base class differs from a concrete class. An abstract class is a class that has one or more pure virtual functions and cannot be instantiated. A concrete class is a type of class that can be instantiated and has no pure virtual function introduction. 

I faced some challenges while working through this workshop, the error part being mainly the syntax. I found various syntax errors as I was doing my implementation. But in the end, my understanding of polymorphism increased.
